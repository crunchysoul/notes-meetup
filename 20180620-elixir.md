## Justin Kudoo - GraphQL with elixir
### General:
- REST vs GraphQL
- multiple endpoint vs one endpoint(subscription using the second one)
- selfdocumenting
- HATEOAS not adopted correctly by people
- specify what you need, custom design request
- easy for fed
- about the same to Tom's talk
- field, argument, fragment, query, mutation, subscription
- custom build library of fragment
- subscription slack live socket
- dude loves GraphicQL
- GraphQL playground
- isomnia
- can have a third endpoint for file upload
- apollo vs relay(good for huge data set, scale)
- the whole getto:
  - everything you use plus Absinthe, Absinthe-plug
- ecto got some issues to Justin, make sense
- react plays nice graphql
### Issues:
- N+1 query, postgraphile target this shit
- Pagination, relay solved this shit
- early technology
### QnA
- hacky solution to n+1
- simplify schema
- absinthe: Batched field resolution (addressing N+1 query problems)
- too many micro services can be tricky
- deploy elixir not that mature
- start quick, go to market quick
- micro service is not good for startups, good for big companies
- fed eco system is really good, cache handle good
- service worker and cache on url
- elixir hit third party api, self end is graphql, stitch rest and graphql
