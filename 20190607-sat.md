- and wrote whole lots of lorem shits
- this is turning into a book club about radio shenanigans
- then this marconi just lied about the whole experiment as being mistake
- maskelyne demos the technique is not good enough, not security
- backdoor being first mentioned in this first famous hack
- fleming fucked as the principle scientist
- marconi is not fucked, cause he's famous and rich
